import { AuthProvider } from '/src/components/apiTutorial/AuthContext';
import LoginEmail from '/src/components/apiTutorial/LoginEmail';

There are multiple ways to obtain an auth token to be used with the API.

## Log in with email through the REST API

:::tip
Make sure you have [registered your email address](/api/start#set-up-the-email-login) in the Blink app to use this method.
:::

<AuthProvider>

  <LoginEmail />

</AuthProvider>

:::caution
The authentication token provides access to your wallet balance, save it securely as a password.
Use it to make authenticated requests on the next pages or set it in the header as `Authorization` `Bearer <ory_token>`.
:::

## Copy the token from the Blink app

* `Create new account`, `Start with trial account` or `Log back in with Phone or Email`
* tap the menu on the top right and scroll down
* select the build number on the bottom 3 times
* select `Copy access token` to save the token to your phone clipboard
