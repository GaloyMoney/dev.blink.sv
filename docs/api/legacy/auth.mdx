There are multiple ways to obtain an auth token to be used with the API.

## Log in with email through the REST API

:::tip
Make sure you have [registered your email address](/api/start#add-an-email-address) in the Blink app to use this method.
:::

<AuthProvider>

  <LoginEmail />

</AuthProvider>

:::caution
The authentication token provides access to your wallet balance, save it securely as a password.
Use it to make authenticated requests on the next pages or set it in the header as `Authorization` `Bearer <ory_token>`.

## Log in with phone and code

Get a 2FA code to your phone number in the Blink app or the Dashboard and use it to log in.
